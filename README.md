# 100-days-of-full-stack
Welcome! This is my attempt of holding myself accountable and finally taking that leap to become a skilled and efficient full stack developer. Each day will be a challenge but by building real projects, focusing on problem solving and documenting each step, I'll be able to record my skill building efforts. 

The goal is simple: To become a highly skilled full stack developer with an impressive portfolio, deep technical knowledge and contribute to the CS world!
