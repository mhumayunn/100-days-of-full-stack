Day 01 – To-Do List App (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

Welcome to Day 1 of my #100DaysOfFullStack challenge!  
Today, I built a basic To-Do List App (surprise surprise) using only HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.

Its features include:
- Add a task to your to-do list
- Prevents adding empty tasks
- Clears the input field after adding
- Dynamically updates the list in real-time
- Simple and responsive UI with centered layout

 Tech Stack:
- HTML5 - Page structure
- CSS3 – Styling and layout
- JavaScript – DOM manipulation and logic

Day01 wasn't an utter disappointment but I realised I'm still slow. Looking forward to day02!
