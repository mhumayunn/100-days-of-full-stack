Welcome to Day 2 of my #100DaysOfFullStack challenge!
Today, I built a Random Quote Generator using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript — and connected it to a simple Node.js + Express backend

Features:
 - Displays a random motivational quote when the button is clicked
- Quotes are stored in a JavaScript array and selected using Math.random()
- Uses a clean, full-width ribbon bar and background image
- Includes a styled button with hover and padding
- Centered and responsive layout for a clean look
- All frontend and backend files organized for future scalability

Tech Stack:
-HTML5 – Markup and structure
-CSS3 – Styling, flexbox layout, responsive design
-JavaScript (Frontend) – Handles quote generation and DOM manipulation
-JavaScript (Backend) – Node.js + Express setup to serve static files

Today’s project felt smoother than Day 01, and it finally clicked that styling matters just as much as functionality. Today I delved into backend and implemented it, connecting front end and backend, learning the theory and then building the project. Still tons to learn, but I’m loving the process so far. On to Day 03!
