Welcome to Day 3 of my #100DaysOfFullStack challenge!

Today, I explored React, Tailwind CSS, and Vite by starting the frontend for a jewelry e-commerce website. The goal was to build a responsive, stylish homepage that lays the foundation for a full-stack store.

Features So Far:
-Top black ribbon and sage green navigation bar
- Navigation links: Best Sellers, Shop, About Us
-Search and cart icons (static for now)
-Hero section with rotating image slider
-Automatically switches images every 5 seconds
-Text overlay with call-to-action

What I Learned Today:
Vite – Ultra-fast development build tool that works perfectly with React projects
React – Reusable component structure and how to manage state and side effects using useState and useEffect
Tailwind CSS – Utility-first CSS framework for quickly styling elements using class names
Component-based design – Broke the homepage into logical pieces like Navbar, ImageSlider, etc.

Tech Stack:
React – Component-based UI library

Tailwind CSS – Utility-first CSS for fast design

Vite – Lightning-fast frontend build tool and dev server

JavaScript (ES6+) – Logic and interactivity

Reflection:
Today was hands-on and filled with troubleshooting — from broken Tailwind setups to understanding PostCSS configs. But once everything clicked, I saw just how powerful and smooth a Vite + React + Tailwind combo can be.

Although I was only able to build the homepage layout and image slider, I feel more confident in my ability to build modular components and style them efficiently.

Excited to push further tomorrow !
